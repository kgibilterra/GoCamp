## Morning Track: Learning Go Fundamentals
###*Paul Burt, EBay*

The workshop will be focused towards folks with little or no programming experience. They will need a Mac, Linux machine, or a Windows machine built within the last 3 years. For Windows users, we'll help them install an Ubuntu VM as part of the first session.

###*First session* 
is all about the command line, how to pass commands arguments, and how to find help. We'll make sure everyone is setup to do some Go, here.

###*Second session* 
is a little bit of C (for history), and then a basic app in Go. We'll cover data types, pointers, importing, and functions. It'll end with folks downloading, compiling, and running a Go program from Github.

###*Third session* 
is about some of the rest of the programming essentials. We'll talk about If-Thens, Loops, and then finish by building a simple web app.

###*Fourth session
is about tackling a challenging problem. I'll ask anyone if they know how to calculate Pi (I expect they'll say No), and then we'll work together as a group to figure it out in Go. The goal is to show them that first, 99% of programming doesn't involve any Math. Up until this point it's all been just how to 'organize' things. And second, when they do run into a Math problem (like calculating Pi), it's actually not that hard if you just ask for help.

##"How a gopher juggles dependencies: vendoring" (Beginner)
###*Filippo Valsorda, Cloudflare*

We'll look at how Go's approach to dependencies is different from other
languages, and what tools are available for it.

Vendoring is here to stay, but the etiquette is not yet consolidated.
For example we are starting to agree that libraries should never vendor
other libraries, because types would then conflict with the ones the
consumer can access.

##"Calling Go from other languages" (Intermediate+)
###*Filippo Valsorda, Cloudflare*

One of my most popular blog posts is "Building Python modules with Go
1.5". It was mostly an experiment to play with the new option to build C
libraries. The post imported the Python API directly to prove you can go
end-to-end. However, building a pure C library and then using FFI you
can elegantly import Go code from most other languages, including
Python, Ruby and Javascript We'll have a look at how and what are the
pitfalls.
